# See the distribution that suit you the most.
Linux come with many distribution or Distros. Picture below is some of them go check it yourself. I chose to install Kali linux because I heard it use for hacking and that sound really cool!

# Enable the window feature
Search for "Turn Window features on or off". Look for "Window subsystem for Linux" and "Virtual Machine Platform" then tick both of them,click ok. This will enable wsl features of your computer and you will have to restart.
